## Introduction

Tailwind CSS has given us a lot of freedom in how we design web components. As a result, it has gained widespread acceptability among developers and IT enterprises.

Tailwind CSS is a highly flexible, low-level, utility-first CSS framework for creating user interfaces quickly.

React Native combines the greatest aspects of native development with React, a world-class JavaScript library for developing user interfaces.

## Installation

First we need to install the `twrnc` package by the following command.

```bash
npm install twrnc
```

## Intellisense

To get proper intellisense in vscode read the following instructions.

- Install [Tailwind CSS IntelliSense](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=bradlc.vscode-tailwindcss) plugin.
- Go to `settings.json` and paste the following code.

```json title="settings.json"
"tailwindCSS.classAttributes": [
    // ...
    "style"
],
// ...
"tailwindCSS.experimental.classRegex": [
    "tw`([^`]*)", // tw`...`
    "tw=\"([^\"]*)", // <div tw="..." />
    "tw={\"([^\"}]*)", // <div tw={"..."} />
    "tw\\.\\w+`([^`]*)", // tw.xxx`...`
    "tw\\(.*?\\)`([^`]*)" // tw(Component)`...`
]
// ...
```

## Usage

You can import the main `tw` function and reach for tw.style only when you need it:

```jsx title="App.js"
import tw from "twrnc";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <View style={tw`bg-blue-100`}>
    <Text style={tw.style("text-md", invalid && "text-red-500")}>Hello</Text>
  </View>
);
```

...or if the tagged template function isn't your cup of tea, just import tw.style as tw:

```jsx title="App.js"
import { style as tw } from "twrnc";

const MyComponent = () => (
  <View style={tw("bg-blue-100", invalid && "text-red-500")}></View>
);
```

## Customizations

You can use twrnc right out of the box if you haven't customized your `tailwind.config.js` file at all. But more likely you've got some important app-specific tailwind customizations you'd like to use. For that reason, we expose the ability to create a **custom configured version** of the tw function object.

```jsx title="lib/tailwind.js"
import { create } from "twrnc";

// create the customized version...
const tw = create(require(`../../tailwind.config.js`)); // <- your path may differ

// ... and then this becomes the main function your app uses
export default tw;
```

...and in your component files import your own customized version of the function instead:

```jsx title="something.js"
import tw from "./lib/tailwind";
```

<Callout emoji="âš ">
  Make sure to use `module.exports = {}` instead of `export default {}` in your
  `tailwind.config.js` file, as the latter is not supported.
</Callout>

## Adding custom classes

To add custom utilities, use the [plugin method](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/adding-new-utilities#using-a-plugin) described in the tailwind docs, instead of writing to a `.css` file.

```jsx title="tailwind.config.js"
const plugin = require("tailwindcss/plugin");

module.exports = {
  plugins: [
    plugin(({ addUtilities }) => {
      addUtilities({
        ".btn": {
          padding: 3,
          borderRadius: 10,
          textTransform: `uppercase`,
          backgroundColor: `#333`,
        },
        ".resize-repeat": {
          resizeMode: `repeat`,
        },
      });
    }),
  ],
};
```
